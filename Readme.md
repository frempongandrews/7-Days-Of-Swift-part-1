Learning Swift By Doing

Hi Everyone

I am Andrews Frempong, a frontend developer and currently learning Swift.

This project is inspired by Sam Lu's 100 Days of Swift project. While learning Swift, I come to know about his project, and I made the decision to commit everyday to write Swift and learn about iOS development; this is the final code of the Swift projects.
